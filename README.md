# OJ Lab Example Front

This will be a simple React APP with Material UI,
and is more likely to be an experiment application.

Example Front will continually update with new features and improvements,
so that we can test OJ Lab Services and make sure it is working as expected.

In other words, we don't pay so much attention to the quality of the code,
either the performance of this front end.
